**1.0 Business Problem**
A blocker fraud company detects the fraudulent transactions happening
The company will receive 25% of the value of each transaction truly detected as fraud;

The company will receive 5% of the value of each transaction detected as fraud, but the transaction is truly legitimate.

The company will return 100% of the value to the customer, for each transaction detected as legitimate, however the transaction is truly a fraud.

With this aggressive strategy, the company assumes the risks of failing to detect fraud and is remunerated for assertive fraud detection.

For the client, it is an excellent business to hire the Blocker Fraud Company. Although the fee charged is very high on success, 25%, the company reduces its costs with fraudulent transactions detected correctly and even the damage caused by an error in the anti-fraud service will be covered by the Blocker Fraud Company itself.

For the company, in addition to getting many customers with this risky strategy to guarantee reimbursement in the event of a failure to detect customer fraud, it depends only on the precision and accuracy of the models built by its Data Scientists, in other words, how much the more accurate the “Blocker Fraud” model, the greater the company's revenue. However, if the model has low accuracy, the company could have a huge loss.

**2.0 Business Assumptions**

Fraud prevention is the implementation of a strategy to detect fraudulent transactions or banking actions and prevent these actions from causing financial damage and the reputation of the client and the financial institution.

There are always financial frauds and they can happen through virtual and physical ways. So the investment in security has been increasing.

The losses caused by fraud can reach R$ 1 billion - which corresponds to half the amount that institutions invest in technology systems aimed at information security every year, according to [Febraban's 2020 Banking Technology Survey](https://blog.simply.com.br/).
